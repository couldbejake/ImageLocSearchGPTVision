If you want to work on this.

- Start from the center of a mobile phone screen.

while cursor is not at button position:
  - overlay a cursor ontop of the image
  - Ask GPT Left, Right, Up or Down
  - ex. GPT says Left
  - Go half way left

  - overlay a cursor ontop of the image
  - Ask GPT Left, Right, Up or Down
  - ex. GPT Says Right
  - Go half of the half way right

  - position found!


simpler solution (void and null), split the image into sections.
super impose a red grid over the image, and ask gpt which square the item is in.
Possibly use a combination of both to get accurate results.
